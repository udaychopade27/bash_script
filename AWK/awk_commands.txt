1.  To print only firstname from csv file
        awk -F , '{print $2}' <filename>.csv        #$2 represent field of firstname

2.  We can print multiple columns using awk
         awk -F , '{print $2, $4}' <filename>.csv

3.  To print last column
        awk -F , '{print $NF}' <filename>.csv

4.  To search a word in csv file
        awk -F , '/<word to be search>/{print $0}' sample.csv

5.  To print a at start of each Line and its line number
        awk -F , '{print NR, $0}' <filename>.csv

6.  To print a given number of line, let say line number 4
        awk -F , 'NR==4, {print NR, $0}' <filename>.csv

7.  To Print the range of lines i.e from line 4 to line 6
        awk -F , 'NR==4, NR==6 {print NR, $0}' <filename>.csv

8.  To print the number of empty lines
        awk -F , 'NF==0 {print NR}' <filename>.csv       #empty lines means there is no fields in line

9.  To search multiple words in single command
        awk -F , '/ <1st word> | <2nd word> | <3rd word> / {print $0}' <filename>.csv

10. To make search case-insensitive
        awk -F , 'BEGIN {IGNORECASE=1} /<word>/ {print $0}' <filename>.csv

11. To check if given character is present in colm or not
        awk -F, '$<colm number> ~ /<character to search>/ {print $0}' <filename>.csv

12. print data of employee whose id is greater than 190
        awk -F, '$1>190 {print $0}' sample.csv

13. To print all users created in linux
        cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print "-" $1 "(UID:"$3")"}'

14. To view status of a processes
        #in place of nginx we can use any service name
        systemctl status nginx | awk 'NR==3 {print $0}'          #this command will print entire 3rd line which contains status of a process
        systemctl status nginx | grep "Active" | awk '{print $2}'      #this line print only active/inactive for that process

15. To list files only names in a column
        ls -ltr | awk 'NR>1 {print $NF}'                            #NR>1 : condition to not print line 1;  $NF: to print last column in output


16. Search for sp.word in file and prints its index and line number
        awk '/Cam/{print NR, index($0, "Cam")}' sample.csv
        
17. Replace word in a file
        awk '{gsub("Mady", "MADY")}' sample.csv

                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                AWK SCRIPTING
1. To find sum of values for a column

    awk -F, 'BEGIN{sum=0}                                           #by default it takes space sapertaed values, but if we are uisng csv file we have to -F to give specific filed saperator
        {sum=sum+$NF}
        END{print "sum of values:" sum}'  filename.csv

2. How to find avearge SALARY
     awk -F, 'BEGIN{sum=0; count=0} 
              NR>1{if($NF>1) count++; sum+=$NF}              #NR>1{if($NF>1)}  this will remove headers from no of employees and also rmove empty lines from docs 
              END{print "sum of salaries: " sum, "No of Employees: " count,  "Average Salary: " sum/count}' employees.csv

3. How to print number of lines in a document
    awk -F, '{} END{print NR} employees.csv

4. How to ignore Headers to count no. of employees correctly and also it will not include empty lines \
     awk -F, 'BEGIN{count=0} NR>1{if($NF>1) count++} END{print "No. of Employees: " count}' employees.csv
             #NR>1 it will not count row 1 or header row
             #if($NF>1) it will not count when it found that no data is in current field

5. print length of longest line 
      awk -F, '{if(length($0)>max) max=length($0)} END{print "length of longest line is " max}' employees.csv

6. print "High" in new column for salary greater than 10k and else "Low"
       awk -F, '{if($NF>10000)$9="High"; else $9="Low"; print $0}' employees.csv

7. print total salary paid to one department in employees.csv file, here for "IT_PROG"
        awk -F, '{if($7=="IT_PROG") sum+=$NF} END{print "Total salary paid to IT_PROG " sum}' employees.csv 


Using AWK pattern and condition in a file
      1. Add our condition and patterns in a file , let say file.awk
      2. awk -f file.awk <file.txt> 
we have to add field saperator in above file to use this pattern with csv file
         awk -F, -f file.awk <file.csv>
